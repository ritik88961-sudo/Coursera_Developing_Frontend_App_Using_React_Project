# 🛍️ E-Commerce Shopping Cart Application using React

## 📜 Introduction

Welcome to my **E-Commerce Shopping Cart Application** built using **React**! This is a simple yet functional shopping cart with features like **Add to Cart**, **Responsive Design**, and **Dynamic Cart Updates**. I built this project while learning React on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/developing-frontend-apps-with-react).

## 🚀 Features

- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly and responsive across different screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Cart Updates**: The number of items in the cart dynamically updates when products are added or removed.
- **Product Listing**: Products are displayed in cards, and users can view details before adding them to the cart.
- **Redux**: Used for state management across the application.
- **React Router**: Used for managing routing between pages (Product Listing, Cart).
